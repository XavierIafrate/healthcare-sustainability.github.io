				<h4>Executive Summary</h4>
				<p>This report aims to introduce and contextualise the issue of laboratory sustainability in the UK. By
					surveying the current technologies and initiatives in the UK and beyond, the report shows that there
					is a slowly growing lab sustainability movement in the UK that requires accelerating. </p>
				<p> By learning from some of the world’s leading laboratories and healthcare institutions in the USA and
					implementing changes quickly (within the next 5 years), the UK could drastically reduce its
					emissions relating to scientific and healthcare research. In turn, this would help the UK meet its
					net-zero goals. </p>
				<p><mark>This report clearly identifies concrete actions that the UK’s research agencies, funding bodies
						and researchers/healthcare providers need to take to support the transition to sustainable
						laboratory and healthcare practices.</mark> These recommendations are concisely summarised in
					the conclusions. Please note that this is an abridged version of the report for readability. For the
					full report, please visit the <a

			<h3 class="section-header">What's the problem?</h3>
			<p>Twenty years ago, few scientists – if any – cared about the sustainability of their laboratory
				practices.<sup><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/420461c" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a></sup> The most recent data available suggest that, in 2018,
				almost £4.8 billion was spent on health and medical research.<sup><a
						href="https://hrcsonline.net/reports/analysis-reports/uk-health-research-analysis-2018/"
						target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[2]</a></sup> This figure grows year on year. Most
				scientists would like to think that they are using grant money efficiently and that the benefits of
				their academic research outweigh any possible deleterious effects on the environment. Unfortunately,
				this is not always true. As the world’s population surpasses 8 billion and our energy requirements
				continue to consume an unsustainable amount of fossil fuels, it is important that everybody reviews
				their environmental impact. As scientists and healthcare workers, we are not simply pardoned because our
				work serves society – our research consumes a disproportionate amount of energy and generates huge
				volumes of waste. </p>

			</div>

			<p> Scientists have a far greater impact on the environment than the average citizen. A recent report from
				the Sustainable Healthcare Coalition estimated that <mark>healthcare research is responsible for 100
					megatonnes of carbon dioxide</mark> equivalent (CO2e) emissions annually.<sup><a
						href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221115154034/https://shcoalition.org/low_carbon_clinical_trials/"
						target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[3]</a></sup> Considering that there are 8.8 million
				scientists globally, and that approximately 12% of these are healthcare researchers, this means that
				<mark>the
					average healthcare scientist could have a carbon footprint of 100 tonnes per year.</mark><sup><a
						href="https://www.who.int/observatories/global-observatory-on-health-research-and-development/monitoring/health-researchers-in-full-time-equivalent-as-a-proportion-of-all-researchers"
						target="_blank" rel="noopener
						noreferrer">[4]</a></sup> That’s a staggering 2,000 times more than the average Bangladeshi
				citizen.<sup><a
						href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230723182859/https://ourworldindata.org/per-capita-co2"
						target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[5] </a></sup> Considering the challenges that
				Bangladesh and other developing nations face with respect to the rising sea levels caused by climate
				change, this statistic crystallises, firstly, the injustice of the climate emergency, and secondly, that
				we scientists are more responsible for this inequality than we may have liked to think.
			</p>
			<div class="hero-callout">
				<h4><mark>The NHS is responsible for a staggering 4% of the UK’s carbon emissions</mark></h4>
			</div>
			<p> and is the largest plastics user in all of Europe.<sup><a
						href="https://noharm-europe.org/sites/default/files/documents-files/6886/2021-09-23-measuring-and-reducing-plastics-in-the-healthcare-sector.pdf"
						target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[6]</a></sup> There is no reason why we
				can’t attempt to reduce this impact while simultaneously upholding excellent levels of care. Good
				quality healthcare and reproducible science relies upon the provision of sterile equipment and
				consistent conditions. These typically take the form of single-use plastics and energy-guzzling heating,
				ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment. </p>
			<p> Due to the complexity of the research ecosystem, the identification and quantification of areas for
				improvement is challenging. Meanwhile, funding bodies are slowly waking up to the idea that
				reducing inefficiencies in research is important from both a stakeholder and a financial
				perspective: grant holders need to learn to do more with less to (1) protect the environment
				and (2) ensure that funds are used effectively. In fact, the Medical Research Council recently announced
				a £1 million grant call seeking solutions to the problem of sustainability in life sciences and medical
				practice.<sup><a
						href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221115153643/https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/environmental-sustainability-in-life-sciences-and-medical-practice/"
						target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[7]</a></sup> However, at present there are no
				tangible incentives for science to be practised more sustainably. </p>
			<p> The UK is planning to double scientific research investment – while simultaneously committing to a
				zero-carbon vision for 2050.<sup><a
						href="https://www.science.org/content/article/uk-cues-big-funding-increases-rd" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">[8]</a></sup> As scientists and as stakeholders in planet Earth, how
				can we meet this challenge within our research institutions? </p>
			<div class="hero-callout">
				<h4><mark>Systemic change is required.</mark></h4>
			</div>
			<p> In this report, I explain the challenges we face in our healthcare and research spaces, and explore
				innovative, translatable solutions to these problems from some of the world’s most forward-thinking
				organisations. Finally, I conclude with some recommendations for stakeholders in science and healthcare
				to allow our scientific community to reach a more sustainable future.</p>

			<h3 class="section-header">Facilities and how people use them.</h3>
			<h4>Facilities</h4>
			<p>Research facilities and the energy that powers them are commonly referred to as scope 1 and scope 2
				emissions, respectively.<sup><a
						href="https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/Corporate-Value-Chain-Accounting-Reporing-Standard_041613_2.pdf"
						target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[9]</a></sup> Scope 1 and 2 emissions can also be
				thought of as ‘direct’ emissions – those that are under the control of the organisation in question, as
				opposed to ‘indirect’ scope 3 emissions which occur as a consequence of other companies’ activities and
				are not controlled by the organisation. <mark>Research facilities are estimated to use 10 times more
					power per unit area than the average family home.</mark> In laboratories, HVAC equipment consumes
				between 40% and 70% of that energy.<sup><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-00772-y"
						target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[10]</a></sup> Therefore, HVAC equipment is clearly a
				priority target for energy-saving measures. Autoclaves and ultra-low temperature (ULT) freezers are
				other obvious targets. See Table 1 for a comparison of the relative energy demands of laboratory
				equipment. The future of research involves more automation and computing power – these machines will
				further add to the energy requirements of hospitals and research centres.</p>

			<p>Since lab equipment is usually shared between multiple groups, these facilities are difficult to manage
				efficiently. However, there are also more ubiquitous and less obvious energy (and water) vampires, such
				as PCR
				machines, incubators, imaging devices, condensers and water baths, et cetera. These all provide
				opportunities
				for energy and water savings.

				However, whilst retrofits and new equipment can increase the efficiency of laboratory spaces, a lot can
				be
				achieved by changing how people use their facilities and equipment. To do this, we need to a) make
				people
				aware of the issues, and b) help them change their behaviour.</p>
			<h4 id="behaviour">Behaviour</h4>
			<p>Every day, scientists make decisions about their research which inadvertently affect the environment. For
				instance, the average scientist would ordinarily not think twice about putting a thermocycler on
				overnight with a
				4 <sup>o</sup>C hold, leaving the fume hood sash half open, or rummaging around in the ULT freezer for a
				few minutes too
				long. These unsustainable practices tend to be well-established and highly ingrained.
			</p>
			<p>
				To change people’s behaviours, one first must understand their motivations. A lab manager might think
				that
				applying electricity shut-off times to lab equipment would be an effective solution to ensure equipment
				does not
				run overnight. However, rules such as this can be surprisingly upsetting for researchers, who are often
				under a
				lot of pressure and feel constrained by time. An overnight shutdown is not an empathetic solution to
				this
				problem because running a machine or experiment overnight is one of the most efficient uses of a
				researcher’s
				time. However, if the lab manager could implement such a scheme that had an opt-out system, then this
				would
				perhaps solve everyone’s problems. Different researchers and practitioners have unique requirements, so
				it is
				crucial that they are involved in decision-making.
			</p>
			<p>
				Anecdotally, implementing sustainable science practices increased the amount of time I had to spend on a
				given
				task. Why? Washing reusable glassware, separating plasticware and taking waste to multiple different
				bins – the
				list of best practices goes on and includes (but is not limited to):
			<ul>
				<li>forward planning to ensure that equipment (e.g. dishwashers, autoclaves) is used efficiently</li>
				<li>consolidating orders to ensure that procurement is as efficient as possible (see <a
						tag="supplyChain">Supply
						Chain</a>)</li>
				<li>ensuring that inventories of fridge/freezer/cold room contents are created and kept up to date so
					that the
					doors are opened for as short a time as possible (therefore people are no longer rummaging around
					for
					missing/misplaced/mislabelled samples unnecessarily)</li>
				<li>adjusting the setpoint of ULT freezers from -80 <sup>o</sup>C to -70 <sup>o</sup>C where necessary
					(reducing compressor
					cycles)</li>
				<li>powering down equipment at the plug after use or fitting power timers on appropriate equipment</li>
				<li>shutting down fume hoods in between use</li>
				<li>not storing chemicals and equipment in fume hoods</li>
				<li>recycling as much waste as possible (see <a tag="supplyChain">Supply
						Chain</a>)</li>
			</ul>

			These additional tasks, while menial, are a burden on researchers’ time and mental load. How then, can we
			help
			scientists adapt to this new way of working?
			</p>
			<div class="hero-callout">
				<h4><mark>The key to changing practice lies in education and
						incentivisation.</mark></h4>
			</div>

			<p>
				Education alone is not enough to change behaviour but is useful to raise awareness. To back this up,
				relevant
				and effective incentives are needed to maintain engagement with sustainability. Incentivisation could
				take the form of intra- or inter-laboratory competitions, conference prizes, or by tying sustainability
				outcomes to funding
				opportunities.
			</p>


			<h5>The Freezer challenge</h5>
			<p>One example of a worldwide initiative is the Freezer Challenge, a competition promoting best freezer
				practices, which has recruited labs in over 27 countries so far.<sup><a
						href="https://www.freezerchallenge.org/" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">[11]</a></sup> This challenge originated in the USA,
				which is leading the way with assessments and initiatives to encourage institutions to be more
				environmentally friendly. Just by tackling this one piece of laboratory equipment, FreezerChallenge.org
				estimates that in 2022, participating laboratories they have saved 6,732 tCO2e – the equivalent energy
				use of 1,310 households (Figure 1).<sup><a href="https://www.freezerchallenge.org/" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">[11]</a></sup> Mitigating emissions from freezers is a particularly
				popular
				strategy in a sustainability manager’s arsenal because behavioural adjustments can in some cases slash
				energy expenditure by up to 30%. These energy savings can subsequently be converted to cost savings and
				used to build business cases for other sustainability improvements.</p>

				alt="infographic detailing energy saving from the Freezer challenge" />

			<p class="quote">"More than doubling the number of labs engaged in this year's Freezer Challenge represents
				a
				tipping point in a broader transition to sustainability across the science industry. The increase not
				only doubled the total amount of carbon saved but helped drive further awareness towards the growing
				green labs movement. We saw a wider variety of labs enter the competition from all over the world,
				including more hospital and clinical labs than ever before, with increased participation from biotech,
				pharmaceutical, and academic labs."</p>
			<p style="text-align: right;">– James Connelly, CEO, My Green Lab</p>
			<h5>Motion And Sash Height (MASH) Alarms</h5>
			<p>While freezers are major contributors to the massive energy demand of research institutes, the main
				energy consumers in labs are usually HVAC equipment – in particular, fume hoods (refer to Table 1). Fume
				hoods are essentially large cupboards with an industrial hoover attached to the roof which pulls air up
				and away from the hood user, thus preventing them and others in the room from inhaling dangerous
				vapours. This air is filtered before being released elsewhere into the local environment. How hard the
				fume hood has to work depends on the sash height: the higher the sash, the wider the aperture, and
				therefore the fume hood has to extract to larger volumes of air to maintain the protective ventilating
				effect (this is termed ‘higher face velocity’ and is akin to trying to suck juice out of a carton using
				a straw with a wider diameter than the one supplied). Sash height is usually limited to further protect
				researchers from splashes, overflows and explosions, but these limits can be – and often are –
				overridden to allow equipment access. When the sash is closed, most fume hoods power down, thus
				consuming far less energy than fume hoods which are left even just slightly open.
			</p>
			<p>To encourage
				researchers to close the fume hoods after working, <mark>‘Shut the Sash’ stickers (or similar) have been
					estimated to cut HVAC energy consumption by around 70% – an energy saving worth $1,300 per hood
					annually.</mark><sup><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-00772-y" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">[10</a>, <a
						href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbuil.2019.00146/full" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">12]</a></sup> Automatic sash closers can save even more energy but,
				from personal experience, these
				devices are prone to misfiring, or even beeping at – and alarming – an unsuspecting scientist in the
				middle of a procedure. This represents a health and safety hazard and can lead to researchers
				consciously disengaging from sustainability; in one facility, the chemists became so fed up with the
				alarms that they jammed pencils in them to stop them working.<sup><a
						href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbuil.2019.00146/full" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">[12]</a></sup> However, when fitted and used properly,
				they work extremely effectively, as shown by research carried out at the Massachusetts Institute of
				Technology (MIT) (Figure 2).<sup><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-00772-y"
						target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[10]</a></sup></p> <img src="/resources/mash.png"
				class="u-full-width" loading="lazy" />
			<p>Figure 2. Average sash height before and after installation of MASH alarms at MIT. Blue = MASH test
				group, n = 17. Red = control group, n = 19 (note: this group did have "Shut the Sash" stickers). It is
				not clear why the control group had a better baseline than the test group. Image courtesy of MIT Open
				Access Articles (CC BY).</p>
			<p>Following these findings, motion and sash height (MASH) alarms are set to be fitted in all of MIT’s new
				buildings. This study also showed that in labs containing multiple fume hoods but with only one MASH
				alarm installed, there was also a significant reduction in average fume hood height.<sup><a
						href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-00772-y" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">[10]</a></sup> The authors
				surmised that just the knowledge that the experiment was taking place influenced the behaviour of
				laboratory users, despite perhaps not having the alarm installed on their own hood. Anecdotally, this
				finding has been echoed in other locations. For this reason, it is important to keep on top of the ‘Shut
				the Sash’ messaging to prevent users reverting to bad practices.</p>
			<h5>Rebates from Facilities</h5>
			<p>At the University of Alabama Birmingham, labs that make efficiency improvements are given ‘credits’ by
				the Estates and Facilities Department. Institutions transitioning to more sustainable laboratory
				practices should find themselves saving money from reduced HVAC and electricity demands. These savings
				can be repurposed into financial rebates to help laboratories fund more efficient equipment, thereby
				creating more opportunities for the institution to save money. This model is already used at the
				University of Alabama Birmingham, where rebates have been used to upgrade ULT freezers to more efficient
				models. Since old ULT freezers can use up to 25 kWh/d, and the newest and most efficient ULT freezers
				consume 7 kWh/d, upgrading a ULT freezer could save an annual 6570 kWh. With today’s electricity prices
				(30p/kWh), this converts to a saving of £1,971. <mark>Therefore, if estates and facilities departments
					were to
					subsidise new freezers by £2,000, the return on investment would be just over one year.</mark></p>
			<p> In addition,
				institutions could use the money saved to invest in what is known as ‘beyond value chain mitigation’ –
				activities that fall outside the value chain which reduce or remove greenhouse gases from the
				atmosphere.<sup><a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/resources/files/Net-Zero-Standard.pdf"
						target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[13]</a></sup> For example, institutions could invest
				in carbon removal credits (see <a tag="reuse">Reuse</a> for an
				explanation of advance market commitments). However, beyond value chain mitigation strategies should not
				be used as an excuse to avoid implementing concrete climate goals.</p>

			<h5>Accountability, Consistency &amp; Transparency labels</h5>
			<p>Another way to make it easier for researchers to achieve their sustainability goals is to upgrade and
				refurbish certain equipment. A significant challenge in this respect is how to assess and compare the
				energy efficiencies of different laboratory equipment. To this end, the not-for-profit organisation My
				Green Lab has created a labelling system to help researchers identify the most environmentally friendly
				(or, more accurately, the least environmentally unfriendly) consumables and equipment. These are known
				as accountability, consistency and transparency (ACT) labels (Figure 3). There are already over 2,300
				pieces of equipment that have ACT labels, and counting.<sup><a
						href="https://web.archive.org/save/https://act.mygreenlab.org/" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">[14]</a></sup> Manufacturers supply details of their
				equipment to an external consultant (SMS Collaborative), who translates this data into the ACT label.
				These labels are revalidated every two years and SMS Collaborative says that, so far, ‘scores are going
				down every time people recertify’.<sup><a
						href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/6tc7Jsx2c6IR5CrOrgt3nG?si=3bf0f50a196a463e"
						target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[15]</a></sup> Participating industry sources have
				confirmed that the ACT label
				has stimulated discussions about how their companies can make environmental improvements to their
				manufacturing processes. However, they also agree that one motivation for participating in the scheme is
				to drive sales with the additional marketing that the publication of this label provides. While the ACT
				labels are audited by an external consultancy, the 1 to 10 grading system is opaque. It is not clear,
				for example, if a company who makes a ‘manufacturing impact reduction’ in 2020, thereby receiving a
				‘green’ score, also gets this ‘green’ score in 2022 upon revalidation, or whether the value is reset to
				‘red’ (e.g. 10, the worst score) if no further improvements have been made since 2020. This would really
				drive innovation, but it would also be seen as unfair if the very same manufacturers that have helped to
				establish the programme were essentially penalised for having been early adopters. Furthermore, the My
				Green Labs model is part-funded by a multitude of equipment and consumable suppliers, many of whom also
				contribute their own data to create ACT labels for themselves. The ACT labels rely on the support of
				industrial backers and therefore there is a risk that these ACT labels are conduits for ‘greenwashing’.
				Certain brands have selectively completed ACT labels for equipment manufactured in high efficiency
				facilities, for example, which could potentially promote a false sense of security when buying other
				products from the same brand. This brand positioning provides a significant conflict of interest that
				may actually erode trust in the My Green Labs scheme. In addition, whereas you can normally find white
				papers or data commons articles for product lifecycle assessments, these are not available from My Green
				Labs. This raises the question: is the ACT scoring system deliberately opaque? Are ACT labels themselves
				accountable, consistent and transparent?</p>

				At the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), the <mark>My Green Lab Certification was
					hailed
					as a ‘key player to help pharmaceutical and medical tech companies achieve the goal of a zero-carbon
					world by
					2050’</mark>. In the UN’s Race to Zero report, it states the aim that ‘95% of labs across major
				pharma and med-tech
				companies are My Green Lab certified at the green-level by 2030’ as a breakthrough outcome (i.e., an
				outcome
				that will drive system change by 2030).
			</p>
			<p>
				My Green Lab has grown rapidly since the Covid-19 pandemic, presumably because the throwaway culture
				around personal protective equipment has opened people’s eyes to the wider problem of waste in
				healthcare and
				research settings. My Green Lab is run ‘for scientists, by scientists’. The messaging is persuasive and
				empowering (‘advocates/activists/ambassadors’, ‘building a global culture of sustainability in
				science’). The
				certification scheme offers tiered pricing for individuals depending on their position. However, if you
				want to
				carry out a My Green Lab certification for your laboratory, it will cost that laboratory hundreds of
				pounds. This
				is a significant barrier to entry for the UK market, because, at the moment, green lab programmes are
				run by
				altruistic students, who will struggle to secure funding – especially considering there is a very
				comprehensive,
				cheaper alternative in the UK (see below).
			</p>

			<h4 id="progress">Progress in the UK</h4>
			<p>In the UK, there are few options for demonstrating environmental credibility in academia. Many of the
				tools
				used in the USA or in industry could be repurposed to provide the UK’s labs with useful tools to
				benchmark
				their laboratory sustainability. Indeed, AstraZeneca, which has committed to the goal of 98%
				decarbonisation of
				its scope 1 and 2 emissions by the year 2026, has won the Freezer Challenge repeatedly. Radical
				collaboration is
				required to repurpose USA-specific initiatives for the UK and, ideally bring them all under one,
				purpose-built
				umbrella for ease of use. We still have the opportunity to do this.
			</p>
			<p>
				Founded in 2020, the Laboratory Efficiency Assessment Framework (LEAF), is a purpose-built platform run
				by
				University College London that can help institutions to build upon their environmental credentials (
				Figure 4 ).<sup><a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/sustainable/leaf/take-part-leaf" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">[16]</a></sup>
				From my own personal experience, it is really easy to use.</p>


			<div class="hero-callout">
				<h4>If research funding bodies were to back LEAF or
					other laboratory sustainability initiatives awards on the policy level, there is little doubt that
					scientific and
					healthcare research would become more sustainable.</h4>
			</div>

			<p>Indeed, a report in 2020 concluded that more research funders should trial policy interventions following
				the success of the Athena SWAN (Scientific Women’s
				Academic Network) accreditation, which caused the percentage of women granted funding to jump from 4% to
				21% between the years of 2011 and 2016.<sup><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m3975"
						target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[17]</a></sup></p>

			<p>Institutions and funding bodies should make it a priority to review the environmental credentials of
				laboratory
				equipment and make allowances for protected grant allocations in the name of improving sustainability. A
				similar type of equipment grant already exists in the form of the UKRI’s ‘core equipment awards’, which
				are
				used to increase research capacity of an institution.<sup><a
						href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230723184245/https://www.ukri.org/councils/epsrc/guidance-for-applicants/types-of-funding-we-offer/core-equipment/"
						target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[18]</a></sup> Further to this, <mark>in instances
					where a laboratory is granted
					funding to increase its capacity, there should be a mechanism to allow the replaced equipment to be
					redistributed to smaller laboratories</mark>. To my knowledge, this type of competitive reallocation
				has not been
				established, although some lab equipment is occasionally sold second-hand. If done correctly, wherein
				the
				funding organisation takes back the used equipment and reallocates it (as opposed to letting the
				equipment
				gather dust or be disposed of unnecessarily) this could help to level up the scientific playing field
				(see: <a tag="widerContext">Wider
					Context of Research in the UK and Beyond</a>).</p>

			<h3 class="section-header">Materials and supply chain</h3>
			<h4>Materials</h4>
			<h5 id="resource">Re-source</h5>
			<p>
				Plastics are usually made from fossil fuels. There is considerable interest in alternative, non-fossil options from
researchers and healthcare practitioners.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230723184359/https://www.england.nhs.uk/greenernhs/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2020/10/delivering-a-net-zero-national-health-service.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[19]</a></sup> Laboratory consumables such as polypropylene centrifuge tubes made
from majority recycled ‘bio-oils’, such as cooking oil, are entering the marketplace now.<sup><a href="https://www.eppendorf.com/product-media/doc/en/5294432/Consumables_White-Paper_078_Tubes-BioBased_Consumables-Made-Bioplastics-Enter-Lab.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[23]</a></sup> Due to additional
capital expenditure from the manufacturer, these more ecologically friendly alternatives may remain more
expensive than the standard fossil fuel-derived equivalents for at least the short term future. Therefore, it is
important that the purchase of more sustainable consumables is incentivised through rebates or tax discounts to
allow demand for eco-friendly materials to build. In the long run, fossil plastics will become more expensive,
and the demand for eco-plastics will scale up such that they can become cheaper.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is scope for innovation in this space – for instance, by sourcing plastics from bio-attributable stocks. For
example, Kelpi has just raised £3 million in seed funding to develop its seaweed-based packaging which is
grease, acid, and water resistant.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230723184725/https://sciencecreates.co.uk/news/kelpi-secures-3m-to-develop-the-next-generation-of-sustainable-bioplastics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[24]</a></sup> Kelpi’s packaging is suitable for existing paper and cardboard recycling
pathways and infrastructure and, furthermore, the company is partnering with food and beverage manufacturers
to come up with materials that are stable to higher temperatures – this is essential if these plastics are to be used
in labs.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230723184813/https://www.kelpi.net/manifesto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[25]</a></sup> In addition to thermal stability, within the laboratory there are additional challenges present for bio-
attributable plastics: they must be waterproof (as opposed to water resistant), not interact at all with biological
substances, be stable to high energy light exposures, and ideally they would be optically pure for microscopy
purposes. Green Elephant Biotech has developed a tissue culture flask made from plant-derived polylactic acid
(PLA) with an estimated 90% smaller carbon footprint than its equivalent fossil plastic-derived cell culture
flask.<sup><a href="https://www.greenelephantbiotech.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[26]</a></sup> However, due to a lack of infrastructure, PLA is not currently widely recycled, so the single-use flasks
are still typically sent for incineration (as all biohazardous waste currently is anyway – see <a tag="recycle">Recycle</a>), resulting in carbon dioxide release. Note that PLA is often referred to as ‘biodegradable’, when in fact the conditions
required for it to biodegrade are almost never met.
			</p>
			<p>
				Over time, to enhance environmental carbon dioxide removal, new petrochemical feedstocks such as CO<sub>2</sub> and
CH<sub>4</sub> should be prioritised and invested in. Two UK-based innovators in this space are Econic Technologies and
LanzaTech: both are developing catalytic methods of converting waste CO<sub>2</sub> into a feedstock that could be used
to make useful polymers (polycarbonates and polyethylene terephthalate, respectively). If these exciting
technologies scale, they will also provide a CO<sub>2</sub> drawdown mechanism that provides additional environmental
benefit.
			</p>
			<h5 id="reduce">Reduce</h5>
			<p>Elimination or reduction approaches sit at the top of the waste management hierarchy. <mark>Since most of the carbon
				footprint of a product is generated by its manufacture and transport, substituting plastics with completely
				recyclable or reusable alternatives is the best way to reduce plastic waste.</mark> On a practical level, researchers may
				be amenable to experimental approaches aimed at reducing their materials consumption. For example, instead of
				making multi-component solutions every time they are needed, a master mix can be made to reduce the number
				of tubes and pipette tips used. This is good laboratory practice in any case because it reduces inter-experimental
				variability. In addition, there are some scenarios where reusable glassware or stainless steel can be used instead
				of single-use plastics. For instance, a lifecycle assessment of disposable acrylic vaginal specula versus stainless
				steel versions showed that the reusable stainless steel one had a lower carbon footprint than the disposable one
				after only two examinations had been completed.<sup>
					<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002937820301459" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[27]</a></sup> </p>
					<div class="hero-callout">
<h5>However, reduction schemes should not stand in the way of
	reproducibility, because having to repeat experiments increases the quantity of consumables used overall.</h5>
					</div>
					
			<h5 id="reuse">Reuse</h5>
			<p>Nowadays, certain laboratory practices, such as cell culture, rely entirely upon the provision of sterile single-use
				polystyrene flasks which are optically clear for microscopy, carry no risk of contamination, and they may even
				be coated with charged proteins to ensure optimal cell adhesion. Returning to glassware in this scenario is not a
				viable solution. In addition, plastic centrifuge tubes are irreplaceable, since they are specially designed for
				centrifuges which rely on having finely balanced rotors. While these items cannot be replaced or eliminated,
				they may possibly be reused. Dr Amy Pickering of the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh says that certain centrifuge
				tubes (Falcon tubes, in this instance) can be reused up to 50 times by rinsing, washing and autoclaving them.
				Over the course of a year, her lab alone is projected to save 20,000 Falcon tubes from landfill/incineration.<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8209715/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[21]</a></sup></p>
			<p>The above example requires researchers to put their own time and effort into the washing and re-sterilising
				process. This is not the only solution, however. Moving to an ‘everything as a service’ (XaaS) business model
				could provide researchers with more eco-friendly, reused consumables at the convenience that they are accustomed to.<sup><a href="https://www.systemiq.earth/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/XaaS-MainReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[28]</a></sup> Although this subscription type service does not yet exist for laboratory equipment and
				consumables, the XaaS economic model clearly does exist (e.g. British toy rental service Whirli) and <mark>it is not
				impossible to envisage a future in which there is a circular economy for lab consumables</mark>. </p>
				<div class="hero-callout">
					<h5>XaaS models in which
						the manufacturer acts as the reuse service makes the manufacturer a ‘producer-owner’, thus incentivising the
						production of higher quality goods to improve reuse characteristics.</h5>

			<h4 id="supplyChain">Supply Chain</h4>
			<p>Scope 3 emissions related to the procurement, transportation, post-processing and disposal of consumables
				are
				typically the largest contributor to emissions resulting from healthcare and scientific research. 9 In
				2019, 62% of
				the NHS’s 25 megatonne carbon footprint was attributed to the supply chain – as compared to 24%
				originating
				from the direct delivery of care. <sup><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(20)30271-0/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[39]</a></sup> These indirect emissions are largely unaccounted for at present as
				there are no
				reporting incentives or legal standards for any of the involved parties (suppliers, researchers,
				universities,
				hospitals, waste handlers). However, industry is realising that it can get ahead of legislation and
				perhaps even
				shape policy itself by reporting its own emissions; environmental pledges and disclosures help them to
				maintain
				its reputation and boost consumer faith, yet maintain control over potentially sensitive, commercially
				relevant
				information. For example, in its quest to cut scope 3 emissions in half by 2030, AstraZeneca has devised
				a
				reporting template for their suppliers to confirm that they have ‘science-based targets’ to get them on
				track for
				net zero themselves.</p>
			<p>How suppliers behave is not outside our control – purchasing directives can create implicit
				sustainability regulation. In particular, the NHS is the largest plastic user in Europe, and nearly a
				quarter (22%)
				of all NHS waste is plastic, which is reflective of the insatiable appetite for single-use plastics that
				we have
				come to accept.<sup><a href="https://noharm-europe.org/sites/default/files/documents-files/6886/2021-09-23-measuring-and-reducing-plastics-in-the-healthcare-sector.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[6]</a></sup> Therefore, the NHS has the clout to exert significant pressure on suppliers by
				applying green
				criteria to its purchasing contracts. The Delivering ‘Net Zero’ National Health Service report echoes
				this need
				for pooled NHS purchasing power to enable sustainable procurement.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230723184359/https://www.england.nhs.uk/greenernhs/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2020/10/delivering-a-net-zero-national-health-service.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[19]</a></sup> Indeed, NHS England has pledged to
				no
				longer purchase plastic stirrers and straws, expanded polystyrene, or single-use plastic cutlery (this
				only covers
				food suppliers for now).<sup><a href="https://www.engage.england.nhs.uk/survey/dee161d9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[40]</a></sup> We can ensure that non-innovative products and manufacturers will be
				gradually
				written out of the value chain by preferentially purchasing superior products.</p>
			<p>Goods procurement in higher education is more fragmented, which is why there is a real need for
				purpose-built
				consortia to apply pressure on manufacturers. Understandably, researchers purchasing consumables tend to
				choose the cheapest product, rather than the ‘greenest’ – partly because they are responsible for their
				own grant
				spending, and also partly because at the moment there is little (if any) accessible information about
				the eco
				credentials of consumables. Most universities have a centralised purchasing marketplace that researchers
				use to
				order goods – this goes some way to help consolidate orders from suppliers where possible. Purchasing
				consortia such as the UK’s not-for-profit Southern Universities Purchasing Consortium (SUPC) have a role
				to
				play here by influencing what products are available to researchers on the procurement marketplace.</p>
			<p>Aside from consortia, <mark>funding bodies can also influence spending habits in laboratories via their
					grant
					allocations</mark>. Since research funding is so competitive, this lever could itself be enough to
				persuade researchers to
				change their behaviour. Firstly, funding criteria should include a consideration of the environmental
				impact of the proposed research. Environmentally costly research should be scrutinised more carefully
				and/or be subject to
				special measures (e.g. enhanced reporting and/or demonstrable improvements over the funding period).
				Secondly, all grants should be allocated with ringfenced funding for laboratory sustainability
				initiatives, such as
				retrofitting autoclaves with water-saving devices, or a requirement to purchase more expensive equipment
				that
				has a longer lifespan than its cheaper alternative.</p>
				<div class="hero-callout">
					<h5>Forcing academics to put forth business cases for
						sustainable
						practices would increase awareness of the environmental problems of scientific research, change
						behaviour and

				</div>
				<p>If we do not achieve system change, we will fail to meet the targets set out in the Paris
					Agreement, and climate change will become even more life threatening. Momentum is building
					for another legally binding United Nations treaty.<sup><a href="https://www.systemiq.earth/systems/circular-materials/planet-positive-chemicals/#report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[41]</a></sup>
					It is not too difficult to envisage a scenario in which, to meet
					ambitious climate targets and prevent a climate tipping point, governments have to step in to curb the actions of
					certain industries. This could result in the introduction of carbon budgets for activities such as scientific
					research. Therefore, <mark>it is important to future-proof by reducing our reliance on energy and resource-intensive
					practices</mark>. If carbon budgets are exceeded, offsets will have to be purchased at the expense of research grants.
					Decarbonising materials and the supply chain could yield important carbon credit savings.

					When thinking about an issue that is as convoluted and opaque as supply chain emissions, it is important to

			<h3 class="section-header">Conclusions</h3>
			<p>This report has discussed a broad range of strategies to tackle waste and inefficiency in the healthcare
				and
				laboratory sciences. In this report, I advocate for sustainability initiatives to be targeted to
				stakeholders based on
				their requirements and level of influence in the research landscape. Therefore, I have separated the
				main
				findings from my report into sections aimed at the key stakeholders: policymakers, funding bodies,
				universities/institutions, industry and researchers.</p>

			<h4 id="policymakers">Recommendations for Policymakers</h4>
			<p>Due to the outsized demands for energy and consumables that originate from healthcare and laboratory
				spaces,
				the idea of research sustainability is gaining momentum among the international community. <mark>In
					practice,
					however, attempts to improve sustainability can be thwarted by misunderstood regulations and old
					frameworks
					that fail to consider the climate emergency and which hinder progress.</mark> A salient example of
				this is the handling
				of biohazardous waste: by law, nothing that has ever touched something ‘biohazardous’ can be recycled –
				despite the fact that many of these items could easily be decontaminated. This will hamper efforts to
				use
				chemical recycling as a means to divert research waste from landfill and incineration. <mark>Therefore,
					I advocate for
					system change brought about by new, purpose-built policies.</mark> This sentiment is also echoed in
				the EU’s Green
				Deal, which calls for a simplified regulatory environment.</p>
			<p>One key tool to accomplish sustainability goals is the establishment of more accurate and reliable
				assessment
				tools to evaluate products and services. For instance, at the moment it is very difficult to assess
				environmental
				claims for so-called ‘greenwashing’, or to carry out lifecycle analyses on goods. While carbon footprint
				analyses
				vary according to the oil market among other things, it should be possible to establish reporting
				standards – but
				we cannot leave it to commercial groups alone to decide which figures they would prefer to report and
				those that
				they would like to leave out. Proposed targets must be validated by an independent body to ensure that
				greenwashing is avoided; the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) standard, and the Partnership for
				Carbon
				Transparency (PACT) framework seem promising in this respect. 13,34,54</p>
			<p>Chemical recycling is seen by some as a complementary process to mechanical recycling, providing a step
				change towards creating a circular plastics economy. However, I think it is better to view chemical
				recycling as
				a method which deals with a separate waste stream that is currently non-recyclable and sent for
				incineration.
				That we, in the UK, continue to incinerate waste in built-up areas is horrifying. In addition to carbon
				dioxide,
				incineration produces toxic chemicals and particulate matter which have adverse health effects on the
				local
				population. 55,56 As discussed previously, chemical recycling could reduce our reliance on incineration.
				Since the
				plans for the first UK depolymerisation plant have been thrown into disarray by financial instability,
				<mark>the
					Government should support the establishment of chemical recycling as a waste stream.</mark> In
				addition, tax reliefs
				for recycled materials and higher taxes or quotas on the use of single-use or non-recyclable material
				could be
				effective policy interventions.
			</p>

			<p>With regards to funding, the creation of ARIA is a big step in the right direction to cut the existing
				inefficiencies
				encountered in the acquisition of science funding. It seems that disruptive, innovative science is not a
				massive
				priority for the Government, but if, in the future, it becomes more of a priority (as it did during the
				Covid-19
				pandemic), there are alternative funding models to pursue. For now, the <mark>Government should focus on
					policies
					that enable industrial scientists and business/venture capital to flow into laboratories so that
					more innovative
					ideas spin out commercially.</mark></p>
			<p>
				Finally, sustainability funding is currently classed as ‘non-essential aid spending’ – which is an issue
				because
				‘non-essential’ spending is the first to be cut in times of hardship. Non-essential aid spending
				(including
				sustainability funding) has been in decline for three consecutive years now [2020-2023]. 57 This is
				short-sighted
				because the climate emergency is just that – an emergency – and cutting funding now results in loss of
				collaborative partnerships and talent that leaves us ill-equipped to tackle future challenges. In
				addition, to attract
				and retain talent in science and healthcare, it is imperative to pay the workers decently enough that
				they can live
				closer to where they work and support themselves and their families without having to find second jobs.
			</p>

			<h4 id="fundingBodies">Recommendations for Funding Bodies</h4>
			<p>In the power dynamics of scientific research, funding bodies sit atop the pyramid. <mark>Together with
					policymakers,
					funding bodies possess incredible power to influence laboratories across the UK – and potentially
					even further
					afield.</mark> Science and healthcare research generate huge amounts of pollution and waste, which
				is harming our
				planet. Environmental health is implicitly linked to human health. Therefore, it is imperative that
				future research
				is done in a sustainable manner. Going forward, access to funding must be bound to credible and
				measurable
				sustainability improvements. LEAF awards (see: <a tag="progress">Progress in the UK</a>) could be used
				to distinguish laboratories
				that are environmentally aware and making progress towards environmentally friendly research practices.
				The
				precedent for this type of incentive is found in the Athena SWAN awards, which has meaningfully
				increased
				gender equality in academia. Research sustainability is the next frontier for funding policy
				interventions.
			</p>
			<p>On the individual level, funding bodies could reduce the impact of research by introducing sustainable
				procurement criteria or travel budgets putting limits on conference travel and/or encouraging
				environmentally
				conscious travel options. Increasing productivity and reducing inefficiencies is a win–win in increasing
				research
				sustainability and innovation. Productivity could be increased by increasing the duration and
				flexibility of
				funding. Innovation could be boosted by increasing researchers’ stipends to a liveable level and perhaps
				by
				allowing principal investigators to access sabbatical funding if they so required it. Finally,
				publishing metrics
				such as the h-index need to be phased out, as they contribute to over-publishing and self-citation,
				which leads to
				decreasing innovation (note: for the academics reading this, REF and TEF are outside of the scope of
				this report
				but I do sympathise).</p>
			<h4 id="institutions">Recommendations for Institutions</h4>
			<p>Change can also be brought about from within: the NHS, private hospitals, and universities must adapt
				quickly
				to a new way of thinking. Institutions are already moving towards sustainable energy procurement.
				Education
				and incentivisation are key to improving research efficiency and changing behaviour. Therefore,
				institutional
				sustainability teams and funding bodies each have important roles to play in influencing scientists.
				Institutions need to ensure that specialist laboratory teams are recruited to understand the needs of
				researchers,
				to implement green lab schemes, and to ensure that awareness remains high despite the relatively high
				turnover
				of students and staff typically seen in research labs and healthcare settings.
			</p>
			<p>
				Permanent technicians focused on sustainability (e.g., to manage washing facilities or complete
				assessments and
				inventories) can help with this and should be employed to alleviate the burden on researchers and to
				increase
				consistency. Pooled technicians can also be funded by the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) council.
				Central
				sustainability teams can also provide financial incentivisation by creating green rebates to distribute
				to energy-
				saving laboratories to allow them to invest in more efficient laboratory equipment.
			</p>
			<p>
				Alongside institutional sustainability teams, funding agencies will play an influential role in applying
				pressure
				to grant applicants, who have jurisdiction over groups of researchers or even whole laboratories.
				Therefore,
				grant holders will be required to collaborate closely with institutional sustainability teams to ensure
				that they
				have oversight of their laboratory’s sustainability metrics.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition, university chancellors and other healthcare executives need to have skin in the game when
				it comes
				to the sustainability of their institutions. I propose that sustainability targets should be integrated
				into
				remuneration for university, healthcare, big pharma, and NHS leaders. 58 These sustainability metrics
				should be
				linked to performance-related pay or bonuses and any resulting penalties should be invested into
				sustainability
				initiatives.
			</p>
			<p>
				On an institution-wide level, sustainability teams are over-promising and under-delivering on their
				zero-waste
				and zero-carbon goals. This is largely because the targets are unrealistic in the first place (see
				Leeds’ ‘Plastic-
				Free by 2023’)! 22 Cynically, one could hypothesise that these empty promises are nothing more than a
				public
				relations or advertising ploy, as students are very concerned about environmental issues. Institutions
				should take
				better responsibility for their wild sustainability targets, perhaps by using some of the frameworks and
				initiatives set out above (e.g., SBTi and PACT).</p>
