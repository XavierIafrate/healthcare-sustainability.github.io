				<h4>Executive Summary</h4>
				<p>This report aims to introduce and contextualise the issue of laboratory sustainability in the UK. By
					surveying the current technologies and initiatives in the UK and beyond, the report shows that there
					is a slowly growing lab sustainability movement in the UK that requires accelerating. </p>
				<p> By learning from some of the world’s leading laboratories and healthcare institutions in the USA and
					implementing changes quickly (within the next 5 years), the UK could drastically reduce its
					emissions relating to scientific and healthcare research. In turn, this would help the UK meet its
					net-zero goals. </p>
				<p><mark>This report clearly identifies concrete actions that the UK’s research agencies, funding bodies
						and researchers/healthcare providers need to take to support the transition to sustainable
						laboratory and healthcare practices.</mark> These recommendations are concisely summarised in
					the conclusions. Please note that this is an abridged version of the report for readability. For the
					full report, please visit the <a href="https://www.churchillfellowship.org/ideas-experts/ideas-library/the-environmental-sustainability-of-science-healthcare-research-in-the-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Churchill Fellowship website</a>.</p>

			<h3 class="section-header">What's the problem?</h3>
			<p>Twenty years ago, few scientists – if any – cared about the sustainability of their laboratory
				practices.<sup><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/420461c" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a></sup> The most recent data available suggest that, in 2018,
				almost £4.8 billion was spent on health and medical research.<sup><a
						href="https://hrcsonline.net/reports/analysis-reports/uk-health-research-analysis-2018/"
						target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[2]</a></sup> This figure grows year on year. Most
				scientists would like to think that they are using grant money efficiently and that the benefits of
				their academic research outweigh any possible deleterious effects on the environment. Unfortunately,
				this is not always true. As the world’s population surpasses 8 billion and our energy requirements
				continue to consume an unsustainable amount of fossil fuels, it is important that everybody reviews
				their environmental impact. As scientists and healthcare workers, we are not simply pardoned because our
				work serves society – our research consumes a disproportionate amount of energy and generates huge
				volumes of waste. </p>

			</div>

			<p> Scientists have a far greater impact on the environment than the average citizen. A recent report from
				the Sustainable Healthcare Coalition estimated that <mark>healthcare research is responsible for 100
					megatonnes of carbon dioxide</mark> equivalent (CO2e) emissions annually.<sup><a
						href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221115154034/https://shcoalition.org/low_carbon_clinical_trials/"
						target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[3]</a></sup> Considering that there are 8.8 million
				scientists globally, and that approximately 12% of these are healthcare researchers, this means that
				<mark>the
					average healthcare scientist could have a carbon footprint of 100 tonnes per year.</mark><sup><a
						href="https://www.who.int/observatories/global-observatory-on-health-research-and-development/monitoring/health-researchers-in-full-time-equivalent-as-a-proportion-of-all-researchers" target="_blank" rel="noopener
						noreferrer">[4]</a></sup> That’s a staggering 2,000 times more than the average Bangladeshi
				citizen.<sup><a
						href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230723182859/https://ourworldindata.org/per-capita-co2"
						target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[5] </a></sup> Considering the challenges that
				Bangladesh and other developing nations face with respect to the rising sea levels caused by climate
				change, this statistic crystallises, firstly, the injustice of the climate emergency, and secondly, that
				we scientists are more responsible for this inequality than we may have liked to think. </p>
			<div class="hero-callout">
				<h4><mark>The NHS is responsible for a staggering 4% of the UK’s carbon emissions</mark></h4>
			</div>
			<p> and is the largest plastics user in all of Europe.<sup><a
						href="https://noharm-europe.org/sites/default/files/documents-files/6886/2021-09-23-measuring-and-reducing-plastics-in-the-healthcare-sector.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[6]</a></sup> There is no reason why we
				can’t attempt to reduce this impact while simultaneously upholding excellent levels of care. Good
				quality healthcare and reproducible science relies upon the provision of sterile equipment and
				consistent conditions. These typically take the form of single-use plastics and energy-guzzling heating,
				ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment. </p>
			<p> Due to the complexity of the research ecosystem, the identification and quantification of areas for
				improvement is challenging. Meanwhile, funding bodies are slowly waking up to the idea that
				reducing inefficiencies in research is important from both a stakeholder and a financial
				perspective: grant holders need to learn to do more with less to (1) protect the environment
				and (2) ensure that funds are used effectively. In fact, the Medical Research Council recently announced
				a £1 million grant call seeking solutions to the problem of sustainability in life sciences and medical
				practice.<sup><a
						href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221115153643/https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/environmental-sustainability-in-life-sciences-and-medical-practice/"
						target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[7]</a></sup> However, at present there are no
				tangible incentives for science to be practised more sustainably. </p>
			<p> The UK is planning to double scientific research investment – while simultaneously committing to a
				zero-carbon vision for 2050.<sup><a
						href="https://www.science.org/content/article/uk-cues-big-funding-increases-rd" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">[8]</a></sup> As scientists and as stakeholders in planet Earth, how
				can we meet this challenge within our research institutions? </p>
			<div class="hero-callout">
				<h4><mark>Systemic change is required.</mark></h4>
			</div>
			<p> In this report, I explain the challenges we face in our healthcare and research spaces, and explore
				innovative, translatable solutions to these problems from some of the world’s most forward-thinking
				organisations. Finally, I conclude with some recommendations for stakeholders in science and healthcare
				to allow our scientific community to reach a more sustainable future.</p>

			<h3 class="section-header">Facilities and how people use them.</h3>
			<h4>Facilities</h4>
			<p>Research facilities and the energy that powers them are commonly referred to as scope 1 and scope 2
				emissions, respectively.<sup><a
						href="https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/Corporate-Value-Chain-Accounting-Reporing-Standard_041613_2.pdf"
						target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[9]</a></sup> Scope 1 and 2 emissions can also be
				thought of as ‘direct’ emissions – those that are under the control of the organisation in question, as
				opposed to ‘indirect’ scope 3 emissions which occur as a consequence of other companies’ activities and
				are not controlled by the organisation. <mark>Research facilities are estimated to use 10 times more
					power per unit area than the average family home.</mark> In laboratories, HVAC equipment consumes
				between 40% and 70% of that energy.<sup><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-00772-y"
						target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[10]</a></sup> Therefore, HVAC equipment is clearly a
				priority target for energy-saving measures. Autoclaves and ultra-low temperature (ULT) freezers are
				other obvious targets. See Table 1 for a comparison of the relative energy demands of laboratory
				equipment. The future of research involves more automation and computing power – these machines will
				further add to the energy requirements of hospitals and research centres.</p>

			<p>Since lab equipment is usually shared between multiple groups, these facilities are difficult to manage
				efficiently. However, there are also more ubiquitous and less obvious energy (and water) vampires, such
				as PCR
				machines, incubators, imaging devices, condensers and water baths, et cetera. These all provide
				opportunities
				for energy and water savings.

				However, whilst retrofits and new equipment can increase the efficiency of laboratory spaces, a lot can
				be
				achieved by changing how people use their facilities and equipment. To do this, we need to a) make
				people
				aware of the issues, and b) help them change their behaviour.</p>
			<h4 id="behaviour">Behaviour</h4>
			<p>Every day, scientists make decisions about their research which inadvertently affect the environment. For
				instance, the average scientist would ordinarily not think twice about putting a thermocycler on
				overnight with a
				4 <sup>o</sup>C hold, leaving the fume hood sash half open, or rummaging around in the ULT freezer for a
				few minutes too
				long. These unsustainable practices tend to be well-established and highly ingrained.
			</p>
			<p>
				To change people’s behaviours, one first must understand their motivations. A lab manager might think
				that
				applying electricity shut-off times to lab equipment would be an effective solution to ensure equipment
				does not
				run overnight. However, rules such as this can be surprisingly upsetting for researchers, who are often
				under a
				lot of pressure and feel constrained by time. An overnight shutdown is not an empathetic solution to
				this
				problem because running a machine or experiment overnight is one of the most efficient uses of a
				researcher’s
				time. However, if the lab manager could implement such a scheme that had an opt-out system, then this
				would
				perhaps solve everyone’s problems. Different researchers and practitioners have unique requirements, so
				it is
				crucial that they are involved in decision-making.
			</p>
			<p>
				Anecdotally, implementing sustainable science practices increased the amount of time I had to spend on a
				given
				task. Why? Washing reusable glassware, separating plasticware and taking waste to multiple different
				bins – the
				list of best practices goes on and includes (but is not limited to):
			<ul>
				<li>forward planning to ensure that equipment (e.g. dishwashers, autoclaves) is used efficiently</li>
				<li>consolidating orders to ensure that procurement is as efficient as possible (see <a tag="supplyChain">Supply
					Chain</a>)</li>
				<li>ensuring that inventories of fridge/freezer/cold room contents are created and kept up to date so that the
					doors are opened for as short a time as possible (therefore people are no longer rummaging around for
					missing/misplaced/mislabelled samples unnecessarily)</li>
				<li>adjusting the setpoint of ULT freezers from -80 <sup>o</sup>C to -70 <sup>o</sup>C where necessary (reducing compressor
					cycles)</li>
				<li>powering down equipment at the plug after use or fitting power timers on appropriate equipment</li>
				<li>shutting down fume hoods in between use</li>
				<li>not storing chemicals and equipment in fume hoods</li>
				<li>recycling as much waste as possible (see <a tag="supplyChain">Supply
						Chain</a>)</li>
			</ul>

			These additional tasks, while menial, are a burden on researchers’ time and mental load. How then, can we
			help
			scientists adapt to this new way of working?
			</p>
			<div class="hero-callout">
				<h4><mark>The key to changing practice lies in education and
					incentivisation.</mark></h4>
			</div>

			<p>
				Education alone is not enough to change behaviour but is useful to raise awareness. To back this up, relevant
and effective incentives are needed to maintain engagement with sustainability. Incentivisation could take the form of intra- or inter-laboratory competitions, conference prizes, or by tying sustainability outcomes to funding
opportunities.

			<h5>The Freezer challenge</h5>
			<p>One example of a worldwide initiative is the Freezer Challenge, a competition promoting best freezer
				practices, which has recruited labs in over 27 countries so far.11 This challenge originated in the USA,
				which is leading the way with assessments and initiatives to encourage institutions to be more
				environmentally friendly. Just by tackling this one piece of laboratory equipment, FreezerChallenge.org
				estimates that in 2022, participating laboratories they have saved 6,732 tCO2e – the equivalent energy
				use of 1,310 households (Figure 1).11 Mitigating emissions from freezers is a particularly popular
				strategy in a sustainability manager’s arsenal because behavioural adjustments can in some cases slash
				energy expenditure by up to 30%. These energy savings can subsequently be converted to cost savings and
				used to build business cases for other sustainability improvements</p> <img
				src="/resources/freezerchallenge.png" class="u-full-width" loading="lazy" />

			<blockquote>More than doubling the number of labs engaged in this year's Freezer Challenge represents a
				tipping point in a broader transition to sustainability across the science industry. The increase not
				only doubled the total amount of carbon saved but helped drive further awareness towards the growing
				green labs movement. We saw a wider variety of labs enter the competition from all over the world,
				including more hospital and clinical labs than ever before, with increased participation from biotech,
				pharmaceutical, and academic labs.</blockquote>
			<p>– James Connelly, CEO, My Green Lab</p>
			<h5>Motion And Sash Height (MASH) Alarms</h5>
			<p>While freezers are major contributors to the massive energy demand of research institutes, the main
				energy consumers in labs are usually HVAC equipment – in particular, fume hoods (refer to Table 1). Fume
				hoods are essentially large cupboards with an industrial hoover attached to the roof which pulls air up
				and away from the hood user, thus preventing them and others in the room from inhaling dangerous
				vapours. This air is filtered before being released elsewhere into the local environment. How hard the
				fume hood has to work depends on the sash height: the higher the sash, the wider the aperture, and
				therefore the fume hood has to extract to larger volumes of air to maintain the protective ventilating
				effect (this is termed ‘higher face velocity’ and is akin to trying to suck juice out of a carton using
				a straw with a wider diameter than the one supplied). Sash height is usually limited to further protect
				researchers from splashes, overflows and explosions, but these limits can be – and often are –
				overridden to allow equipment access. When the sash is closed, most fume hoods power down, thus
				consuming far less energy than fume hoods which are left even just slightly open. To encourage
				researchers to close the fume hoods after working, ‘Shut the Sash’ stickers (or similar) have been
				estimated to cut HVAC energy consumption by around 70% – an energy saving worth $1,300 per hood
				annually.10,12 Automatic sash closers can save even more energy but, from personal experience, these
				devices are prone to misfiring, or even beeping at – and alarming – an unsuspecting scientist in the
				middle of a procedure. This represents a health and safety hazard and can lead to researchers
				consciously disengaging from sustainability; in one facility, the chemists became so fed up with the
				alarms that they jammed pencils in them to stop them working.12 However, when fitted and used properly,
				they work extremely effectively, as shown by research carried out at the Massachusetts Institute of
				Technology (MIT) (Figure 2).10</p> <img src="/resources/mash.png" class="u-full-width" loading="lazy" />
			<p>Figure 2. Average sash height before and after installation of MASH alarms at MIT. Blue = MASH test
				group, n = 17. Red = control group, n = 19 (note: this group did have "Shut the Sash" stickers). It is
				not clear why the control group had a better baseline than the test group. Image courtesy of MIT Open
				Access Articles (CC BY).</p>
			<p>Following these findings, motion and sash height (MASH) alarms are set to be fitted in all of MIT’s new
				buildings. This study also showed that in labs containing multiple fume hoods but with only one MASH
				alarm installed, there was also a significant reduction in average fume hood height.10 The authors
				surmised that just the knowledge that the experiment was taking place influenced the behaviour of
				laboratory users, despite perhaps not having the alarm installed on their own hood. Anecdotally, this
				finding has been echoed in other locations. For this reason, it is important to keep on top of the ‘Shut
				the Sash’ messaging to prevent users reverting to bad practices.</p>
			<h5>Rebates from Facilities</h5>
			<p>At the University of Alabama Birmingham, labs that make efficiency improvements are given ‘credits’ by
				the Estates and Facilities Department. Institutions transitioning to more sustainable laboratory
				practices should find themselves saving money from reduced HVAC and electricity demands. These savings
				can be repurposed into financial rebates to help laboratories fund more efficient equipment, thereby
				creating more opportunities for the institution to save money. This model is already used at the
				University of Alabama Birmingham, where rebates have been used to upgrade ULT freezers to more efficient
				models. Since old ULT freezers can use up to 25 kWh/d, and the newest and most efficient ULT freezers
				consume 7 kWh/d, upgrading a ULT freezer could save an annual 6570 kWh. With today’s electricity prices
				(30p/kWh), this converts to a saving of £1,971. Therefore, if estates and facilities departments were to
				subsidise new freezers by £2,000, the return on investment would be just over one year. In addition,
				institutions could use the money saved to invest in what is known as ‘beyond value chain mitigation’ –
				activities that fall outside the value chain which reduce or remove greenhouse gases from the
				atmosphere.13 For example, institutions could invest in carbon removal credits (see REUSE for an
				explanation of advance market commitments). However, beyond value chain mitigation strategies should not
				be used as an excuse to avoid implementing concrete climate goals.</p>
			<h5>ACCOUNTABILITY, CONSISTENCY AND TRANSPARENCY LABELS</h5>
			<p>Another way to make it easier for researchers to achieve their sustainability goals is to upgrade and
				refurbish certain equipment. A significant challenge in this respect is how to assess and compare the
				energy efficiencies of different laboratory equipment. To this end, the not-for-profit organisation My
				Green Lab has created a labelling system to help researchers identify the most environmentally friendly
				(or, more accurately, the least environmentally unfriendly) consumables and equipment. These are known
				as accountability, consistency and transparency (ACT) labels (Figure 3). There are already over 2,300
				pieces of equipment that have ACT labels, and counting.14 Manufacturers supply details of their
				equipment to an external consultant (SMS Collaborative), who translates this data into the ACT label.
				These labels are revalidated every two years and SMS Collaborative says that, so far, ‘scores are going
				down every time people recertify’.15 Participating industry sources have confirmed that the ACT label
				has stimulated discussions about how their companies can make environmental improvements to their
				manufacturing processes. However, they also agree that one motivation for participating in the scheme is
				to drive sales with the additional marketing that the publication of this label provides. While the ACT
				labels are audited by an external consultancy, the 1 to 10 grading system is opaque. It is not clear,
				for example, if a company who makes a ‘manufacturing impact reduction’ in 2020, thereby receiving a
				‘green’ score, also gets this ‘green’ score in 2022 upon revalidation, or whether the value is reset to
				‘red’ (e.g. 10, the worst score) if no further improvements have been made since 2020. This would really
				drive innovation, but it would also be seen as unfair if the very same manufacturers that have helped to
				establish the programme were essentially penalised for having been early adopters. Furthermore, the My
				Green Labs model is part-funded by a multitude of equipment and consumable suppliers, many of whom also
				contribute their own data to create ACT labels for themselves. The ACT labels rely on the support of
				industrial backers and therefore there is a risk that these ACT labels are conduits for ‘greenwashing’.
				Certain brands have selectively completed ACT labels for equipment manufactured in high efficiency
				facilities, for example, which could potentially promote a false sense of security when buying other
				products from the same brand. This brand positioning provides a significant conflict of interest that
				may actually erode trust in the My Green Labs scheme. In addition, whereas you can normally find white
				papers or data commons articles for product lifecycle assessments, these are not available from My Green
				Labs. This raises the question: is the ACT scoring system deliberately opaque? Are ACT labels themselves
				accountable, consistent and transparent?</p>

			<h3 class="section-header">Conclusions</h3>
			<p>This report has discussed a broad range of strategies to tackle waste and inefficiency in the healthcare and
				laboratory sciences. In this report, I advocate for sustainability initiatives to be targeted to stakeholders based on
				their requirements and level of influence in the research landscape. Therefore, I have separated the main
				findings from my report into sections aimed at the key stakeholders: policymakers, funding bodies,
				universities/institutions, industry and researchers.</p>

				<h4 id="policymakers">Recommendations for Policymakers</h4>
				<p>Due to the outsized demands for energy and consumables that originate from healthcare and laboratory spaces,
					the idea of research sustainability is gaining momentum among the international community. <mark>In practice,
					however, attempts to improve sustainability can be thwarted by misunderstood regulations and old frameworks
					that fail to consider the climate emergency and which hinder progress.</mark> A salient example of this is the handling
					of biohazardous waste: by law, nothing that has ever touched something ‘biohazardous’ can be recycled –
					despite the fact that many of these items could easily be decontaminated. This will hamper efforts to use
					chemical recycling as a means to divert research waste from landfill and incineration. <mark>Therefore, I advocate for
					system change brought about by new, purpose-built policies.</mark> This sentiment is also echoed in the EU’s Green
					Deal, which calls for a simplified regulatory environment.</p>
					<p>One key tool to accomplish sustainability goals is the establishment of more accurate and reliable assessment
						tools to evaluate products and services. For instance, at the moment it is very difficult to assess environmental
						claims for so-called ‘greenwashing’, or to carry out lifecycle analyses on goods. While carbon footprint analyses
						vary according to the oil market among other things, it should be possible to establish reporting standards – but
						we cannot leave it to commercial groups alone to decide which figures they would prefer to report and those that
						they would like to leave out. Proposed targets must be validated by an independent body to ensure that
						greenwashing is avoided; the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) standard, and the Partnership for Carbon
						Transparency (PACT) framework seem promising in this respect. 13,34,54</p>
						<p>Chemical recycling is seen by some as a complementary process to mechanical recycling, providing a step
							change towards creating a circular plastics economy. However, I think it is better to view chemical recycling as
							a method which deals with a separate waste stream that is currently non-recyclable and sent for incineration.
							That we, in the UK, continue to incinerate waste in built-up areas is horrifying. In addition to carbon dioxide,
							incineration produces toxic chemicals and particulate matter which have adverse health effects on the local
							population. 55,56 As discussed previously, chemical recycling could reduce our reliance on incineration. Since the
							plans for the first UK depolymerisation plant have been thrown into disarray by financial instability, <mark>the
							Government should support the establishment of chemical recycling as a waste stream.</mark> In addition, tax reliefs
							for recycled materials and higher taxes or quotas on the use of single-use or non-recyclable material could be
							effective policy interventions.</p>

					<p>With regards to funding, the creation of ARIA is a big step in the right direction to cut the existing inefficiencies
						encountered in the acquisition of science funding. It seems that disruptive, innovative science is not a massive
						priority for the Government, but if, in the future, it becomes more of a priority (as it did during the Covid-19
						pandemic), there are alternative funding models to pursue. For now, the <mark>Government should focus on policies
						that enable industrial scientists and business/venture capital to flow into laboratories so that more innovative
						ideas spin out commercially.</mark></p>
					<p>
						Finally, sustainability funding is currently classed as ‘non-essential aid spending’ – which is an issue because
						‘non-essential’ spending is the first to be cut in times of hardship. Non-essential aid spending (including
						sustainability funding) has been in decline for three consecutive years now [2020-2023]. 57 This is short-sighted
						because the climate emergency is just that – an emergency – and cutting funding now results in loss of
						collaborative partnerships and talent that leaves us ill-equipped to tackle future challenges. In addition, to attract
						and retain talent in science and healthcare, it is imperative to pay the workers decently enough that they can live
						closer to where they work and support themselves and their families without having to find second jobs.

				<h4 id="fundingBodies">Recommendations for Funding Bodies</h4>
				<p>In the power dynamics of scientific research, funding bodies sit atop the pyramid. <mark>Together with policymakers,
					funding bodies possess incredible power to influence laboratories across the UK – and potentially even further
					afield.</mark> Science and healthcare research generate huge amounts of pollution and waste, which is harming our
					planet. Environmental health is implicitly linked to human health. Therefore, it is imperative that future research
					is done in a sustainable manner. Going forward, access to funding must be bound to credible and measurable
					sustainability improvements. LEAF awards (see: <a tag="progress">Progress in the UK</a>) could be used to distinguish laboratories
					that are environmentally aware and making progress towards environmentally friendly research practices. The
					precedent for this type of incentive is found in the Athena SWAN awards, which has meaningfully increased
					gender equality in academia. Research sustainability is the next frontier for funding policy interventions.
					</p>
					<p>On the individual level, funding bodies could reduce the impact of research by introducing sustainable
						procurement criteria or travel budgets putting limits on conference travel and/or encouraging environmentally
						conscious travel options. Increasing productivity and reducing inefficiencies is a win–win in increasing research
						sustainability and innovation. Productivity could be increased by increasing the duration and flexibility of
						funding. Innovation could be boosted by increasing researchers’ stipends to a liveable level and perhaps by
						allowing principal investigators to access sabbatical funding if they so required it. Finally, publishing metrics
						such as the h-index need to be phased out, as they contribute to over-publishing and self-citation, which leads to
						decreasing innovation (note: for the academics reading this, REF and TEF are outside of the scope of this report
						but I do sympathise).</p>
				<h4 id="institutions">Recommendations for Institutions</h4>
				<p>Change can also be brought about from within: the NHS, private hospitals, and universities must adapt quickly
					to a new way of thinking. Institutions are already moving towards sustainable energy procurement. Education
					and incentivisation are key to improving research efficiency and changing behaviour. Therefore, institutional
					sustainability teams and funding bodies each have important roles to play in influencing scientists.
					Institutions need to ensure that specialist laboratory teams are recruited to understand the needs of researchers,
					to implement green lab schemes, and to ensure that awareness remains high despite the relatively high turnover
					of students and staff typically seen in research labs and healthcare settings.
				</p><p>
					Permanent technicians focused on sustainability (e.g., to manage washing facilities or complete assessments and
					inventories) can help with this and should be employed to alleviate the burden on researchers and to increase
					consistency. Pooled technicians can also be funded by the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) council. Central
					sustainability teams can also provide financial incentivisation by creating green rebates to distribute to energy-
					saving laboratories to allow them to invest in more efficient laboratory equipment.
				</p><p>
					Alongside institutional sustainability teams, funding agencies will play an influential role in applying pressure
					to grant applicants, who have jurisdiction over groups of researchers or even whole laboratories. Therefore,
					grant holders will be required to collaborate closely with institutional sustainability teams to ensure that they
					have oversight of their laboratory’s sustainability metrics.
				</p><p>
					In addition, university chancellors and other healthcare executives need to have skin in the game when it comes
					to the sustainability of their institutions. I propose that sustainability targets should be integrated into
					remuneration for university, healthcare, big pharma, and NHS leaders. 58 These sustainability metrics should be
					linked to performance-related pay or bonuses and any resulting penalties should be invested into sustainability
					initiatives.
				</p><p>
					On an institution-wide level, sustainability teams are over-promising and under-delivering on their zero-waste
					and zero-carbon goals. This is largely because the targets are unrealistic in the first place (see Leeds’ ‘Plastic-
					Free by 2023’)! 22 Cynically, one could hypothesise that these empty promises are nothing more than a public
					relations or advertising ploy, as students are very concerned about environmental issues. Institutions should take
					better responsibility for their wild sustainability targets, perhaps by using some of the frameworks and
					initiatives set out above (e.g., SBTi and PACT).</p>

			<hr />
			<p>Throughout the course of my master’s degree and PhD, I have helped to develop pharmaceuticals, tested
				novel polymers, synthesised nanoparticles, and genetically engineered cells. Having been welcomed into
				all sorts of laboratories in different countries, I became frustrated at the wastefulness of certain
				types of laboratory research, and the lack of attention this issue has been given. </p>
			<p>I hope that by bringing some of the ingrained, systemic issues in research practice into the light, we
				can make the necessary changes to ensure that scientific progress does notcome at the expense of the
				planet.</p>
