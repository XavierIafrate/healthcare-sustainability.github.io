				<h4>Executive Summary</h4>
				<p>This report aims to introduce and contextualise the issue of laboratory sustainability in the UK. By
					surveying the
					current technologies and initiatives in the UK and beyond, the report shows that there is a slowly
					growing <mark>lab
						sustainability movement in the UK that requires accelerating.</mark>
				</p>
				<p>
					By learning from some of the world’s leading
					laboratories and healthcare institutions in the USA and implementing changes quickly (within the
					next 5 years),
					<mark>the UK could drastically reduce its emissions relating to scientific and healthcare
						research.</mark> In turn, this would
					help the UK meet its net-zero goals.
				</p>
				<p>This report clearly identifies concrete actions that the UK’s research agencies,
					funding bodies and researchers/healthcare providers need to take to support the transition to
					sustainable laboratory
					and healthcare practices. These recommendations are concisely summarised in the conclusions.</p>

			<h3 class="section-header">What's the problem?</h3>
			<p>Twenty years ago, few scientists – if any – cared about the sustainability of their laboratory
				practices.<sup><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/420461c" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a></sup> The most
				recent data available suggest that, in 2018, almost £4.8 billion was spent on health and medical
				research.2 This
				figure grows year on year. Most scientists would like to think that they are using grant money
				efficiently and that
				the benefits of their academic research outweigh any possible deleterious effects on the environment.
				Unfortunately, this is not always true. As the world’s population surpasses 8 billion and our energy
				requirements
				continue to consume an unsustainable amount of fossil fuels, it is important that everybody reviews
				their
				environmental impact. As scientists and healthcare workers, we are not simply pardoned because our work
				serves
				society – our research consumes a disproportionate amount of energy and generates huge volumes of waste.

			</p>
			<p>

				Scientists have a far greater impact on the environment than the average citizen. A recent report from
				the
				Sustainable Healthcare Coalition estimated that <mark>healthcare research is responsible for 100
					megatonnes of carbon
					dioxide</mark> equivalent (CO2e) emissions annually.3 Considering that there are 8.8 million
				scientists globally, and that
				approximately 12% of these are healthcare researchers, this means that the average healthcare scientist
				could have
				a carbon footprint of 100 tonnes per year.4 That’s a staggering 2,000 times more than the average
				Bangladeshi
				citizen.5 Considering the challenges that Bangladesh and other developing nations face with respect to
				the rising
				sea levels caused by climate change, this statistic crystallises, firstly, the injustice of the climate
				emergency, and
				secondly, that we scientists are more responsible for this inequality than we may have liked to think.

			</p>

			<p>

				The<mark> NHS is responsible for a staggering 4% of the UK’s carbon emissions</mark>, and is the largest
				plastics user in all
				of Europe.6 There is no reason why we can’t attempt to reduce this impact while simultaneously upholding
				excellent levels of care. Good quality healthcare and reproducible science relies upon the provision of
				sterile
				equipment and consistent conditions. These typically take the form of single-use plastics and
				energy-guzzling
				heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment.
			</p>
			<p>
				Due to the complexity of the research ecosystem, the identification and quantification of areas for
				improvement
				is challenging. Meanwhile, funding bodies are slowly waking up to the idea that <mark>reducing
					inefficiencies in research
					is important from both a stakeholder and a financial perspective</mark>: grant holders need to learn
				to do more with less
				to (1) protect the environment and (2) ensure that funds are used effectively. In fact, the Medical
				Research Council
				recently announced a £1 million grant call seeking solutions to the problem of sustainability in life
				sciences and
				medical practice.7 However, at present there are no tangible incentives for science to be practised more
				sustainably.
			</p>
			<p>
				The UK is planning to double scientific research investment – while simultaneously committing to a
				zero-carbon
				vision for 2050.8 As scientists and as stakeholders in planet Earth, how can we meet this challenge
				within our
				research institutions?
			</p>

			<p>
				In this report, I explain the challenges we face in our healthcare and research spaces,
				and explore innovative, translatable solutions to these problems from some of the world’s most
				forward-thinking
				organisations. Finally, I conclude with some recommendations for stakeholders in science and healthcare
				to allow
				our scientific community to reach a more sustainable future.</p>

			<h3 class="section-header">Facilities and how people use them.</h3>
			<h4>Facilities</h4>
			<p>Research facilities and the energy that powers them are commonly referred to as scope 1 and scope 2
				emissions,
				respectively.9 Scope 1 and 2 emissions can also be thought of as ‘direct’ emissions – those that are
				under the
				control of the organisation in question, as opposed to ‘indirect’ scope 3 emissions which occur as a
				consequence
				of other companies’ activities and are not controlled by the organisation. <mark>Research facilities are
					estimated to use
					10 times more power per unit area than the average family home.</mark> In laboratories, HVAC
				equipment consumes
				between 40% and 70% of that energy.10 Therefore, HVAC equipment is clearly a priority target for
				energy-saving
				measures. Autoclaves and ultra-low temperature (ULT) freezers are other obvious targets. See Table 1 for
				a
				comparison of the relative energy demands of laboratory equipment. The future of research involves more
				automation and computing power – these machines will further add to the energy requirements of hospitals
				and
				research centres.</p>

			<p>Since the pieces of equipment shown in Table 1 are most often shared between multiple groups and
				therefore
				serve between tens and hundreds of users, these facilities are difficult to manage efficiently. However,
				there are
				less obvious energy (and water) vampires, such as PCR machines, incubators, imaging devices and water
				baths,
				which all need attention too. Autoclaves, condensers and water distillers are also extremely water
				intensive, and
				there are opportunities to apply water-saving measures to these pieces of apparatus. Note that the scope
				of this
				report does not include the energy sourcing or efficiency of the buildings themselves; centralised teams
				must
				prioritise building and infrastructure improvements, as well as their transition to green energy.
				Although retrofits and new equipment do help to increase the efficiency of laboratory spaces, a lot can
				be achieved
				by changing how people use their facilities and equipment. To do this, we need to a) make people aware
				of the
				issues, and b) help them change their behaviour.</p>
			<h4 id="behaviour">Behaviour</h4>
			<p>Every day, scientists make decisions about their research which inadvertently affect the environment. For
				instance,
				the average scientist would ordinarily not think twice about putting a thermocycler on overnight with a
				4 oC hold,
				leaving the fume hood sash half open, or rummaging around in the ULT freezer for a minute too long. Some
				well-
				established and/or highly ingrained laboratory practices must be challenged in order to decrease the
				environmental
				impact of healthcare research.
				However, rules implemented unilaterally by laboratory managers can be surprisingly upsetting for
				researchers,
				who are often under a lot of pressure and feel constrained by time. Laboratory sustainability is
				undeniably
				inconvenient. For example, asking researchers not to run experiments overnight so that equipment can be
				shut
				down is not an empathetic solution; sometimes there isn’t enough time to run these experiments in the
				day and
				we must also recognise that scientists’ time is valuable. There is no ‘one size fits all’ key
				performance indicator
				(KPI) for sustainability in healthcare research. Different researchers and practitioners have unique
				requirements,
				and to understand these it is crucial that they are involved in decision-making.
				In my experience, I know that implementing sustainable science practices increased the amount of time I
				would
				typically spend on a task. Why? Washing reusable glassware, separating plasticware and taking waste to
				multiple
				different bins – the list of best practices goes on and includes (but is not limited to):
			<ul>
				<li>forward planning to ensure that equipment (e.g. dishwashers, autoclaves) is used efficiently</li>
				<li>consolidating orders to ensure that procurement is as efficient as possible (see Materials and
					Supply
					Chain)</li>
				<li>ensuring that inventories of fridge/freezer/cold room contents are created and kept up to date so
					that
					the
					doors are opened for as short a time as possible (therefore people are no longer rummaging around
					for
					missing/misplaced/mislabelled samples unnecessarily)</li>
				<li>adjusting the setpoint of ULT freezers from -80 oC to -70 oC where necessary (reducing compressor
					cycles)</li>
				<li>powering down equipment at the plug after use or fitting power timers on appropriate equipment</li>
				<li>shutting down fume hoods in between use</li>
				<li>not storing chemicals and equipment in fume hoods</li>
				<li>recycling as much waste as possible (see <a tag="materialsAndSupplyChain">Materials and Supply Chain</a>)</li>
			</ul>
			These additional tasks, while menial, are a burden on researchers’ time and mental load. How then, can
			we help
			scientists adapt to this new way of working? The key to changing practice lies in education and
			incentivisation.
			Education alone is not enough to change behaviour. The consensus at the 2022 My Green Lab summit was
			that
			bespoke incentives are needed for researchers to change their scientific practice or engage with green
			lab activities.
			Incentivisation could take the form of intra- or inter-laboratory competitions, conference prizes, or by
			tying
			sustainability outcomes to funding opportunities. These initiatives must be kept fresh and relevant to
			maintain
			engagement.
			Case Study: Andrew King, the Health, Safety and Environment Director at AstraZeneca, detailed a
			successful
			engagement strategy in which his team encouraged researchers to identify their own areas of opportunity
			and
			constraint. By empowering researchers to identify their chosen KPIs, the AstraZeneca team ase able to
			gain high
			buy-in from researchers and assess where additional support was needed. The KPI dashboard showed
			scientists
			that they really were driving change within the organisation. Furthermore, by equating energy and
			emission
			savings to cost savings on the KPI dashboard, labs were able to compete with each other across different
			locations. This gamification resulted in AstraZeneca’s first ever 100% response rate to a sustainability
			initiative.
			Engagement is crucial because AstraZeneca is aiming to become carbon negative across its entire value
			chain by
			2030 – a mammoth task!
			Somewhat unsurprisingly, free swag and awards are popular incentives for scientists. However, it is
			important to
			consider the needs of researchers before offering them things that they might not want. One of the most
			cost-
			effective and universally popular items to give out is, according to Nick Ciancio of the University of
			Alabama
			Birmingham, stickers! Stickers are extremely efficient tools because when designed in a concise,
			eye-catching
			way, they can provide effective prompts that change behaviour. Take, for instance, Shut the Sash fume
			hood
			stickers (to be discussed later). A bright design with the message ‘Be safe. Save energy. Shut the Sash’
			stuck near
			the sash handle or fume hood light switch is effective and cheap. These stickers will save far more
			money than it
			costs to print them and hand them out. In addition, stickers provide free advertising – win-win!
			Behaviour can be influenced by incentives and policies, and there is evidence to show that researchers
			want
			science to be more environmentally friendly. The Million Advocates for Sustainable Science is a
			scientist-led
			group campaigning for top-down system change to ensure that financial resources from funding bodies are
			allocated to the most environmentally responsible and efficient laboratories. With 460 signatories
			(including me),
			this shows that a growing tide of scientists have an appetite for transformation in their own
			workplaces. However,
			implementing change can spook researchers due to the additional demands it invariably places on their
			time. It is
			important to introduce changes gradually. For instance, Ziyu Li of the University of Colorado Boulder
			describes
			a technique to build commitment to the Green Labs scheme by approaching researchers to sign a Green Labs
			pledge before gradually, over weeks and months, sending recommendations and checklists to improve
			environmental sustainability. Signatories to the pledge are posted on an attractive-looking poster to
			provide
			motivation to other labs. In addition, Green Lab awards (e.g., bronze, silver, gold) promote a positive
			culture
			around lab sustainability.
			Healthcare institutions in the USA are home to some of the most progressive sustainability initiatives.
			Because
			US hospitals are not taxpayer funded, they are subject to market forces, and therefore they must decide
			how best
			to attract patients. Often, they do this by becoming a ‘benevolent force’ in the community, for instance
			by putting
			on outreach events, sponsored activities, or undertaking research that is relevant to their local
			population. US
			institutions therefore understand that the health of individuals is intrinsically linked to the health
			of the surrounding environment and, as a result, there is much interest in institutional sustainability
			as a way to build
			trust with local communities.
			The following are selected laboratory and healthcare initiatives aimed at improving facilities and how
			people use
			them from the USA that could be translated to the UK:</p>

			<h5>The Freezer challenge</h5>
			<p>One example of a worldwide initiative is the Freezer Challenge, a competition promoting best freezer
				practices,
				which has recruited labs in over 27 countries so far.11 This challenge originated in the USA, which is
				leading the
				way with assessments and initiatives to encourage institutions to be more environmentally friendly. Just
				by
				tackling this one piece of laboratory equipment, FreezerChallenge.org estimates that in 2022,
				participating
				laboratories they have saved 6,732 tCO2e – the equivalent energy use of 1,310 households (Figure 1).11
				Mitigating
				emissions from freezers is a particularly popular strategy in a sustainability manager’s arsenal because
				behavioural
				adjustments can in some cases slash energy expenditure by up to 30%. These energy savings can
				subsequently be
				converted to cost savings and used to build business cases for other sustainability improvements</p>

			<blockquote>More than doubling the number of labs engaged in this year's Freezer Challenge represents a
				tipping point in a
				broader transition to sustainability across the science industry. The increase not only doubled the
				total amount
				of carbon saved but helped drive further awareness towards the growing green labs movement. We saw a
				wider
				variety of labs enter the competition from all over the world, including more hospital and clinical labs
				than ever
				before, with increased participation from biotech, pharmaceutical, and academic labs.</blockquote>
			<p>– James Connelly, CEO, My Green Lab</p>

			<h5>Motion And Sash Height (MASH) Alarms</h5>
			<p>While freezers are major contributors to the massive energy demand of research institutes, the main
				energy
				consumers in labs are usually HVAC equipment – in particular, fume hoods (refer to Table 1). Fume hoods
				are
				essentially large cupboards with an industrial hoover attached to the roof which pulls air up and away
				from the
				hood user, thus preventing them and others in the room from inhaling dangerous vapours. This air is
				filtered before
				being released elsewhere into the local environment. How hard the fume hood has to work depends on the
				sash
				height: the higher the sash, the wider the aperture, and therefore the fume hood has to extract to
				larger volumes
				of air to maintain the protective ventilating effect (this is termed ‘higher face velocity’ and is akin
				to trying to
				suck juice out of a carton using a straw with a wider diameter than the one supplied). Sash height is
				usually limited
				to further protect researchers from splashes, overflows and explosions, but these limits can be – and
				often are –
				overridden to allow equipment access. When the sash is closed, most fume hoods power down, thus
				consuming
				far less energy than fume hoods which are left even just slightly open.
				To encourage researchers to close the fume hoods after working, ‘Shut the Sash’ stickers (or similar)
				have been
				estimated to cut HVAC energy consumption by around 70% – an energy saving worth $1,300 per hood
				annually.10,12 Automatic sash closers can save even more energy but, from personal experience, these
				devices are
				prone to misfiring, or even beeping at – and alarming – an unsuspecting scientist in the middle of a
				procedure.
				This represents a health and safety hazard and can lead to researchers consciously disengaging from
				sustainability;
				in one facility, the chemists became so fed up with the alarms that they jammed pencils in them to stop
				them
				working.12 However, when fitted and used properly, they work extremely effectively, as shown by research
				carried
				out at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) (Figure 2).10</p>
			<img src="/resources/mash.png" class="u-full-width" />
			<p>Figure 2. Average sash height before and after installation of MASH alarms at MIT. Blue = MASH test
				group, n
				= 17. Red = control group, n = 19 (note: this group did have “Shut the Sash” stickers). It is not clear
				why the
				control group had a better baseline than the test group. Image courtesy of MIT Open Access Articles (CC
				BY).</p>

			<p>Following these findings, motion and sash height (MASH) alarms are set to be fitted in all of MIT’s new
				buildings.
				This study also showed that in labs containing multiple fume hoods but with only one MASH alarm
				installed,
				there was also a significant reduction in average fume hood height.10 The authors surmised that just the
				knowledge
				that the experiment was taking place influenced the behaviour of laboratory users, despite perhaps not
				having the
				alarm installed on their own hood. Anecdotally, this finding has been echoed in other locations. For
				this reason,
				it is important to keep on top of the ‘Shut the Sash’ messaging to prevent users reverting to bad
				practices.</p>

			<h5>Rebates from Facilities</h5>
			<p>At the University of Alabama Birmingham, labs that make efficiency improvements are given ‘credits’ by
				the
				Estates and Facilities Department. Institutions transitioning to more sustainable laboratory practices
				should find
				themselves saving money from reduced HVAC and electricity demands. These savings can be repurposed into
				financial rebates to help laboratories fund more efficient equipment, thereby creating more
				opportunities for the
				institution to save money. This model is already used at the University of Alabama Birmingham, where
				rebates
				have been used to upgrade ULT freezers to more efficient models. Since old ULT freezers can use up to 25
				kWh/d,
				and the newest and most efficient ULT freezers consume 7 kWh/d, upgrading a ULT freezer could save an
				annual
				6570 kWh. With today’s electricity prices (30p/kWh), this converts to a saving of £1,971. Therefore, if
				estates
				and facilities departments were to subsidise new freezers by £2,000, the return on investment would be
				just over
				one year.
				In addition, institutions could use the money saved to invest in what is known as ‘beyond value chain
				mitigation’
				– activities that fall outside the value chain which reduce or remove greenhouse gases from the
				atmosphere.13 For
				example, institutions could invest in carbon removal credits (see REUSE for an explanation of advance
				market
				commitments). However, beyond value chain mitigation strategies should not be used as an excuse to avoid
				implementing concrete climate goals.</p>

			<h5>ACCOUNTABILITY, CONSISTENCY AND TRANSPARENCY LABELS</h5>
			<p>Another way to make it easier for researchers to achieve their sustainability goals is to upgrade and
				refurbish
				certain equipment. A significant challenge in this respect is how to assess and compare the energy
				efficiencies of
				different laboratory equipment. To this end, the not-for-profit organisation My Green Lab has created a
				labelling
				system to help researchers identify the most environmentally friendly (or, more accurately, the least
				environmentally unfriendly) consumables and equipment. These are known as accountability, consistency
				and
				transparency (ACT) labels (Figure 3). There are already over 2,300 pieces of equipment that have ACT
				labels,
				and counting.14 Manufacturers supply details of their equipment to an external consultant (SMS
				Collaborative),
				who translates this data into the ACT label. These labels are revalidated every two years and SMS
				Collaborative
				says that, so far, ‘scores are going down every time people recertify’.15 Participating industry sources
				have
				confirmed that the ACT label has stimulated discussions about how their companies can make environmental
				improvements to their manufacturing processes. However, they also agree that one motivation for
				participating in
				the scheme is to drive sales with the additional marketing that the publication of this label provides.
				While the ACT labels are audited by an external consultancy, the 1 to 10 grading system is opaque. It is
				not clear,
				for example, if a company who makes a ‘manufacturing impact reduction’ in 2020, thereby receiving a
				‘green’
				score, also gets this ‘green’ score in 2022 upon revalidation, or whether the value is reset to ‘red’
				(e.g. 10, the
				worst score) if no further improvements have been made since 2020. This would really drive innovation,
				but it
				would also be seen as unfair if the very same manufacturers that have helped to establish the programme
				were
				essentially penalised for having been early adopters.
				Furthermore, the My Green Labs model is part-funded by a multitude of equipment and consumable
				suppliers,
				many of whom also contribute their own data to create ACT labels for themselves. The ACT labels rely on
				the
				support of industrial backers and therefore there is a risk that these ACT labels are conduits for
				‘greenwashing’.
				Certain brands have selectively completed ACT labels for equipment manufactured in high efficiency
				facilities,
				for example, which could potentially promote a false sense of security when buying other products from
				the same
				brand. This brand positioning provides a significant conflict of interest that may actually erode trust
				in the My
				Green Labs scheme. In addition, whereas you can normally find white papers or data commons articles for
				product
				lifecycle assessments, these are not available from My Green Labs. This raises the question: is the ACT
				scoring
				system deliberately opaque? Are ACT labels themselves accountable, consistent and transparent?</p>

			<h4>Dr Madeleine Luck</h4>
			<hr />
			<p>Throughout the course of my master’s degree and PhD, I have helped to develop pharmaceuticals, tested
				novel
				polymers, synthesised nanoparticles, and genetically engineered cells. Having been welcomed into all
				sorts of
				laboratories in different countries, I became frustrated at the wastefulness of certain types of
				laboratory research,
				and the lack of attention this issue has been given.
			</p>
			<p>I hope that by bringing some of the ingrained, systemic issues
				in research practice into the light, we can make the necessary changes to ensure that scientific
				progress does not
				come at the expense of the planet.</p>
