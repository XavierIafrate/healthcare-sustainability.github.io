				<h4>Executive Summary</h4>
				<p>This report aims to introduce and contextualise the issue of laboratory sustainability in the UK. By
					surveying the
					current technologies and initiatives in the UK and beyond, the report shows that there is a slowly
					growing <mark>lab
						sustainability movement in the UK that requires accelerating.</mark>
				</p>
				<p>
					By learning from some of the world’s leading
					laboratories and healthcare institutions in the USA and implementing changes quickly (within the
					next 5 years),
					<mark>the UK could drastically reduce its emissions relating to scientific and healthcare
						research.</mark> In turn, this would
					help the UK meet its net-zero goals.
				</p>
				<p>This report clearly identifies concrete actions that the UK’s research agencies,
					funding bodies and researchers/healthcare providers need to take to support the transition to
					sustainable laboratory
					and healthcare practices. These recommendations are concisely summarised in the conclusions.</p>

			<h3 class="section-header">What's the problem?</h3>
			<p>Twenty years ago, few scientists – if any – cared about the sustainability of their laboratory
				practices.1 The most
				recent data available suggest that, in 2018, almost £4.8 billion was spent on health and medical
				research.2 This
				figure grows year on year. Most scientists would like to think that they are using grant money
				efficiently and that
				the benefits of their academic research outweigh any possible deleterious effects on the environment.
				Unfortunately, this is not always true. As the world’s population surpasses 8 billion and our energy
				requirements
				continue to consume an unsustainable amount of fossil fuels, it is important that everybody reviews
				their
				environmental impact. As scientists and healthcare workers, we are not simply pardoned because our work
				serves
				society – our research consumes a disproportionate amount of energy and generates huge volumes of waste.

			</p>
			<p>

				Scientists have a far greater impact on the environment than the average citizen. A recent report from
				the
				Sustainable Healthcare Coalition estimated that <mark>healthcare research is responsible for 100
					megatonnes of carbon
					dioxide</mark> equivalent (CO2e) emissions annually.3 Considering that there are 8.8 million
				scientists globally, and that
				approximately 12% of these are healthcare researchers, this means that the average healthcare scientist
				could have
				a carbon footprint of 100 tonnes per year.4 That’s a staggering 2,000 times more than the average
				Bangladeshi
				citizen.5 Considering the challenges that Bangladesh and other developing nations face with respect to
				the rising
				sea levels caused by climate change, this statistic crystallises, firstly, the injustice of the climate
				emergency, and
				secondly, that we scientists are more responsible for this inequality than we may have liked to think.

			</p>
			<p>

				The<mark> NHS is responsible for a staggering 4% of the UK’s carbon emissions</mark>, and is the largest
				plastics user in all
				of Europe.6 There is no reason why we can’t attempt to reduce this impact while simultaneously upholding
				excellent levels of care. Good quality healthcare and reproducible science relies upon the provision of
				sterile
				equipment and consistent conditions. These typically take the form of single-use plastics and
				energy-guzzling
				heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment.
			</p>
			<p>
				Due to the complexity of the research ecosystem, the identification and quantification of areas for
				improvement
				is challenging. Meanwhile, funding bodies are slowly waking up to the idea that <mark>reducing
					inefficiencies in research
					is important from both a stakeholder and a financial perspective</mark>: grant holders need to learn
				to do more with less
				to (1) protect the environment and (2) ensure that funds are used effectively. In fact, the Medical
				Research Council
				recently announced a £1 million grant call seeking solutions to the problem of sustainability in life
				sciences and
				medical practice.7 However, at present there are no tangible incentives for science to be practised more
				sustainably.
			</p>
			<p>
				The UK is planning to double scientific research investment – while simultaneously committing to a
				zero-carbon
				vision for 2050.8 As scientists and as stakeholders in planet Earth, how can we meet this challenge
				within our
				research institutions?

				In this report, I explain the challenges we face in our healthcare and research spaces,
				and explore innovative, translatable solutions to these problems from some of the world’s most
				forward-thinking
				organisations. Finally, I conclude with some recommendations for stakeholders in science and healthcare
				to allow
				our scientific community to reach a more sustainable future.</p>

			<h3 class="section-header">Facilities and how people use them.</h3>
			<h4>Facilities</h4>
			<p>Research facilities and the energy that powers them are commonly referred to as scope 1 and scope 2 emissions,
				respectively.9 Scope 1 and 2 emissions can also be thought of as ‘direct’ emissions – those that are under the
				control of the organisation in question, as opposed to ‘indirect’ scope 3 emissions which occur as a consequence
				of other companies’ activities and are not controlled by the organisation. <mark>Research facilities are estimated to use
				10 times more power per unit area than the average family home.</mark> In laboratories, HVAC equipment consumes
				between 40% and 70% of that energy.10 Therefore, HVAC equipment is clearly a priority target for energy-saving
				measures. Autoclaves and ultra-low temperature (ULT) freezers are other obvious targets. See Table 1 for a
				comparison of the relative energy demands of laboratory equipment. The future of research involves more
				automation and computing power – these machines will further add to the energy requirements of hospitals and
				research centres.</p>

			<h4>Dr Madeleine Luck</h4>
			<hr />
			<p>Throughout the course of my master’s degree and PhD, I have helped to develop pharmaceuticals, tested
				novel
				polymers, synthesised nanoparticles, and genetically engineered cells. Having been welcomed into all
				sorts of
				laboratories in different countries, I became frustrated at the wastefulness of certain types of
				laboratory research,
				and the lack of attention this issue has been given.
			</p>
			<p>I hope that by bringing some of the ingrained, systemic issues
				in research practice into the light, we can make the necessary changes to ensure that scientific
				progress does not
				come at the expense of the planet.</p>
