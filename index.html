          <h4>Executive Summary</h4>
          <p>This report aims to introduce and contextualise the issue of laboratory sustainability in the UK. By surveying the
            current technologies and initiatives in the UK and beyond, the report shows that there is a slowly growing lab
            sustainability movement in the UK that requires accelerating. 
            </p><p>
            By learning from some of the world’s leading
            laboratories and healthcare institutions in the USA and implementing changes quickly (within the next 5 years),
            the UK could drastically reduce its emissions relating to scientific and healthcare research. In turn, this would
            help the UK meet its net-zero goals. 
        </p><p>This report clearly identifies concrete actions that the UK’s research agencies,
            funding bodies and researchers/healthcare providers need to take to support the transition to sustainable laboratory
            and healthcare practices. These recommendations are concisely summarised in the conclusions.</p>

        <h3 class="section-header">What's the problem?</h3>
        <p>Twenty years ago, few scientists – if any – cared about the sustainability of their laboratory practices.1 The most
          recent data available suggest that, in 2018, almost £4.8 billion was spent on health and medical research.2 This
          figure grows year on year. Most scientists would like to think that they are using grant money efficiently and that
          the benefits of their academic research outweigh any possible deleterious effects on the environment.
          Unfortunately, this is not always true. As the world’s population surpasses 8 billion and our energy requirements
          continue to consume an unsustainable amount of fossil fuels, it is important that everybody reviews their
          environmental impact. As scientists and healthcare workers, we are not simply pardoned because our work serves
          society – our research consumes a disproportionate amount of energy and generates huge volumes of waste.

        </p><p>

          Scientists have a far greater impact on the environment than the average citizen. A recent report from the
          Sustainable Healthcare Coalition estimated that healthcare research is responsible for 100 megatonnes of carbon
          dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions annually.3 Considering that there are 8.8 million scientists globally, and that
          approximately 12% of these are healthcare researchers, this means that the average healthcare scientist could have
          a carbon footprint of 100 tonnes per year.4 That’s a staggering 2,000 times more than the average Bangladeshi
          citizen.5 Considering the challenges that Bangladesh and other developing nations face with respect to the rising
          sea levels caused by climate change, this statistic crystallises, firstly, the injustice of the climate emergency, and
          secondly, that we scientists are more responsible for this inequality than we may have liked to think.

        </p><p>

          The NHS is responsible for a staggering 4% of the UK’s carbon emissions, and is the largest plastics user in all
          of Europe.6 There is no reason why we can’t attempt to reduce this impact while simultaneously upholding
          excellent levels of care. Good quality healthcare and reproducible science relies upon the provision of sterile
          equipment and consistent conditions. These typically take the form of single-use plastics and energy-guzzling
          heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment.
        </p><p>
          Due to the complexity of the research ecosystem, the identification and quantification of areas for improvement
          is challenging. Meanwhile, funding bodies are slowly waking up to the idea that reducing inefficiencies in research
          is important from both a stakeholder and a financial perspective: grant holders need to learn to do more with less
          to (1) protect the environment and (2) ensure that funds are used effectively. In fact, the Medical Research Council
          recently announced a £1 million grant call seeking solutions to the problem of sustainability in life sciences and
          medical practice.7 However, at present there are no tangible incentives for science to be practised more
          sustainably.
        </p><p>
          The UK is planning to double scientific research investment – while simultaneously committing to a zero-carbon
          vision for 2050.8 As scientists and as stakeholders in planet Earth, how can we meet this challenge within our
          research institutions?

          In this report, I explain the challenges we face in our healthcare and research spaces,
          and explore innovative, translatable solutions to these problems from some of the world’s most forward-thinking
          organisations. Finally, I conclude with some recommendations for stakeholders in science and healthcare to allow
          our scientific community to reach a more sustainable future.</p>
